## Food

### From experience
- **Duck Duck Goat** (3/3)
	- Delicious!!! Innovative Chinese food by the founder of Girl and the Goat. The decor is quite modernized Chinatown (somehow reminded me of the Met Gala with Chinese theme a few years back). Great spot for dining alone and sitting ar the bar.
	- Reservation is a must. Highly recommend the Peking Duck and the Chongqing Chicken.
- **Girl and the Goat** (3/3)
	- Small plates, modern american cuisine. 
- **Bombobar** (3/3)
	- Can’t say no to delicious gelato. It also happens to be in the perfect spot — right by my favorite restaurants / bars for a late night bite. 
- **Sizzling Pot King Chicago** (3/3)
	- Delicious sizzling pot with diverse flavoring and ingredients! Love this place. 
- **RPM Steak** (2/3)
	- Classic established steakhouse — solid steak. definitely more of a corporate card, special occasion and/or cheat day pick. 
- **Gyu-Kaku Japanese BBQ** (2/3)
	- Exactly like the rest of the chain restaurants, delicious, nice fall back, nothing super special. 
- **Jeni’s Splendid Ice creams** (2/3) 
	- I don’t even eat ice cream often and I dig it! 
- **Bongo Room** (2/3)
	- Popular brunch spot — small space, very cozy with great brunch food. 
- **Fat Rice** (2/3)
	- Macau cuisine, which is a cross of Portuguese and Chinese food. I liked it a lot. 
- **Do-Rite Donuts ans Chicken** (1/3)
	- My first time having a Donut burger with donuts and spicy chicken! I’m not huge into donuts but that burger was solid. 
- **Wildberry Pancakes and Cafe** (1/3) 
	- Decent brunch spot — very popular so come early. 
- **Au Cheval** (1/3)
	- Very famous for brunch and their burger — I was a huge fan of it though, a bit too salty. 
- **Firecakes Donut** (1/3) 
	- Nothing memorable — but in their defense, we arrived quite late so probably all the good donuts ran out. 
- **Lou Malnati’s Pizzeria** (1/3)
	- Classic Chicago Deep dish — not my favorite but decent food. 
- **Magnolia Bakery** (1/3)
	- Jenn and Andy were quite crazy over the spot — sweets is not my thing but it’s supposed to be decent.

## Drinks

### From experience
- **Moneygun** (3/3)
	- Speakeasy through a diner, serves food alongside drinks. The place was packed at 6pm on a Wednesday so I’d suggest come early or be prepared to stand. Very casual and neighborhood friendly vibe.
	- I came here with Maria and the waitress Elise was so sweet and took great care of us. My favorite drink was home by midnight, their old fashioned is also delicious. 
- **The Aviary** (3/3)
	- My absolute favorite spot in Chicago for fancy drinks. They take cocktails VERY seriously, with hundreds of different types of ice and containers for a show — mixology is truly an art here. The food here is also quite good. I’d recommend the oyster with champagne foams.
	- It’s a bit snotty and hard to walk-in, so I’d definitely recommend making reservations. My favorite drink was the slingshot old fashioned. 
- **The Office** (3/3)
	- The speakeasy downstairs from the Aviary. Unlike the modern decor upstairs, the office looks like an old-school cigar lounge with leather chairs and dim lights. 
	- The spirit collection and the cocktail are beyond words. The bartender provides very high-touch service to make sure you get a unique cocktail based on your palette. I’d suggest to go off the menu and go wild here. If you can think it, the bartender can make it.
	- Reservation is hard to secure so book early. In additions, their food is equally amazing so don’t miss out! 
- **Z Bar** (2/3)
	- Fairly small and basic hotel bar at the Peninsula with great drinks. No complaints on any front, but to be honest, it’s nothing outstanding in comparison to the collection of amazing bars in Chicago. 
	- This place also has a small patio so summer day must be quite nice. 
- **Three Dash and a Dot** (2/3)
	- Tiki bar, not my scene, but decent drinks and great vibes for people who like Tiki bars!

## Lodging

### From experience
- **Hotel EMC2, Autograph Collection** (3/3)
	- Let me just say — O M G. This is literally one of my favorite hotel of ALL TIMES. Their room services are delivered by robots. Let me repeats. ROBOTS — named Leo and Cleo. You text them what you want, and the robot brings it up in 5 minutes. You can even order via the in-room Alexa!!! I’m thoroughly amazed and obsessed. 
- **Moxy Chicago Downtown**(1/3)
	- Young hotel, the lobby is always popping with people getting drunk and hanging out. The beds are queen size and the rooms quite tiny — not my favorite.
