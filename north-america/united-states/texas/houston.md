## Food

### From experience
- **Uchi** (3/3)
    - Japanese cuisine. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here. I went for the Omakase (Signature tasting, can't wait to try the Chef's tasting next time), and it was quite a fun gastronomic journey. The appetizer and wine/sake selection were amazing as well -- you can't chase me away from the edamame and shishito with a pitchfork. Beware -- the lines are long so make a reservation!
- **Oporto Fooding House and Wine** (3/3)
    - Portughese tapas. I definitely recommend the Cataplana Mussels -- I still dream about it from time to time. The squit fried rice is another one of my favorite. 
- **Pepper Twins 双椒 (Kirby Dr)** (3/3)
    - I need a good Chinese restaurant in every city. Pepper Twins on Kirby Drive is gonna be my Houston go-to from now on. I've actually never personally been to this place -- but my best friend @ytong1015 got me some takeout that was to die for. Definitely oreder the Pepper Twins Fish Fillet (藤椒鱼片), Golden Eggplant (蟹黄茄子) and the Farm Chicken Herb Soup (药膳土鸡汤)...alright I must stop before my drool hits the floor. 

### My to-try list

- **Indigo** fine dining, contemporary soul food
- **Theodore Rex** Tomato toast
- **The Breakfast Klub** CHICKEN AND WAFFLES
- **Mala Sichuan Bistro** Another Chinese restaurant to try
- **B & B Butchers** Think meat first, dry-aged meat with Kobe available on the menu

## Drinks

### From experience

- **Bayou & Bottle** (3/3)
    - Fantastic bar with tailored cocktail and relaxing atmosphere. I came here for happy hour during a conference -- the bar passed my old fashioned test with flying colors, and surprised me with some innovative cocktails. It's located inside the Four Seasons lobby so definitely more a traveler's bar than a local's bar.

### My to-try list

- **Tongue-Cut Sparrow** more formal cocktail bar vibe, speakeasy, through a staircase in the back of Pastry War, small space
- **The Ready Room** jazz bar, old-school vibe
- **OKRA Charity Saloon** very cool venue and concept; non-profit bar
- **Anvil Bar & Refuge** craft cocktail scene
- **Julep** known for great bartenders (Alba Huerta), one of the best cocktails bars in America
- **Captain Foxheart's Bad News Bar & Spirits Lodge** old-style cocktails, right in downtown 
- **Reserve 101** best whiskey bar in Texas by Thrillist
- **Public Services Wine & Whiskey** long list of whiskey and wine
- **Better Luck Tomorrow (BLT)** fun neighbourhood hang out spot
- **Saint Arnold Brewing Company** Houston’s oldest craft brewery

## Destinations

### From experience

- **Discovery Green** (2/3)
    - Nice area to hang out at with good art additions. 
- **Minute Maid Park** (1/3)

### My to-try list

- **Montrose Distict**  Montrose has become the city’s hub of vintage shopping, live music, and LGBT activism. Restored mansions and bungalows, tree-lined boulevards, and an antique mall make this neighborhood a unique, pedestrian-friendly tourist spot.
- **Space Center Houston**
- **Buffalo Bayou Park**
- **Hines Waterwall Park** The park features a 64 ft semi circular fountain that re-circulates 11,000 gallons of water per minute that tumbles down the structure’s inner and outer walls.

## Lodging

### From experience

- **Marriott Marquis Houston** (3/3)
    - THERE IS A LAZY RIVER IN THE SHAPE OF TEXAS. Enough said. Go and enjoy it.
    - Also best location if you are at a conference because it's connected to the conference center. 
    - Don't eat at the lobby restaurants -- I tried 3 of them and they all sucked. :(
- **Houston Marriott Medical Center/Museum District** (1/3)

### My to-try list

- **Four Seasons Hotel Houston**
    - Honestly just want to stay there because the lobby bar is awesome.
