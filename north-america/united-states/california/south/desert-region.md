## Food

### From experience

- **(Yucca Valley) La Copine** (2/3)
    - I've been there twice -- this place is run by an all female crew (adorable couple owners), serves American food, walk-in only, and open only during weird hours (2-7 pm). If you want to eat here, make sure to come mid-afternoon (3-4 pm)for a shorter wait. 
    - Such a place is normally too hipster/high-maintenance for my taste...but it somehow works in the dessert. The food is really great for Joshua Tree, but slightly overpriced for the worth in my opinion. The fried chicken and the waitress named Alli are my personal favorites about this place. 

### My to-try list

- **(Palm Springs) **

## Destinations

### From experience

- **(Cabazon) Desert Hills Premium Outlets** (3/3)
    - OKAY IT'S THE ASIAN IN ME. There's something about outlets and sale signs that just makes everything more attractive. This is probably the biggest/best outlet I've ever been to -- it has every brand you can every think of and so many good finds if you have time and energy! (Slowly caressing my Sergio Rossi heels as I'm typing this bit...)
- **(Joshua Tree) Joshua Tree National Park** (3/3)
    - Mesmerizing nature. It looks like a short drive but it's definite worth a full day for exploration. Make sure you wear shoes with good grip and long pants in case you want to try climbing some of the lower rocks! 
    - There are a ton of stops in the park, but my personal musts are:
        - Cottonwood Spring
        - Cholla Cactus Garden
        - Skull Rock
        - Keys View

### My to-try list

- **(Twentynine Palms) Smith’s Ranch** drive-in cinema

## Art & Architecture

### From experience

### My to-try list

- **(Joshua Tree) Noah Purifoy Outdoor Desert Art Museum**
- **(Rancho Mirage) Sunnylands**
    - the former Annenberg Estate, historic location. Sunnylands is to some extent regarded as the "Camp David of the West".
- **(Slab City) Salvation Mountain**
    - amazing art project by Leonard Knight

## Lodging

### From experience

- **(Pioneertown) [Off Grid It House](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/19606)** (3/3)
    - Let me just say. O. M. G. I've been eyeing this place for years and finally got the chance to go in 2019. The architecture gives you maximum exposure to the nature and surroundings. There's absolutely no one around you and you get to soak in the nature 100%. You can truly fall asleep to the stars and wake up to the sunrise -- or to coyotes, other visitors have reported sightings.
    - One tiny problem. This place is literally off the grid, which means the water pressure is abysmal, the lights are dim at night, and the stove is slow. It takes planning and preparation, but this place is such a unique experience and worth the work. 
- **(Rancho Mirage) The Ritz-Carlton, Rancho Mirage** (3/3)
    - This Ritz is HUGE, and comes with great resort/spa and activites. I really like their guided nature walks in the morning and star gazing sessions at night. 
    - The luxury is exactly what you need when you are sweaty and tired from the nature related activites.
