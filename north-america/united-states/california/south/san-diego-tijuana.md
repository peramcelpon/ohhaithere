## Destinations

### From experience

- **Balboa Park** (3/3)
    - I'm putting everything in the bracket, including San Diego Zoo, Japanese Friendship Garden, Botanical Building, San Diego Museum of Man, Casa Del Prady:SDYS, San Diego Natural History Museum etc
- **Hotel del Coronado** (3/3)
    - I debated between Destination and Lodging, and decided it's better suited as a destination. This hotel is historic, grand, and legendary. You can google all the stars and movies shot at this spot and the architecture significance, so I won't waste any more words. This place is worth a visit even if you decide to stay somewhere else.
- **U.S.S. Midway Museum** (2/3) 

### My to-try list

- **SeaWorld San Diego** 
- **La Jolla Cove**

## Lodging

### From experience

- **The US Grant, Luxury Collection, San Diego** (3/3)
    - Easily the best hotel in San Diego in my opinion. Historic, Classy, and it comes with a fantastic bar -- I simply love everything about this place.
    - Pop by the bar to try the Centennial cocktail! It's made with a special blend of High West that's only sold at this hotel bar. 
- **Hotel Republic San Diego, Autograph Collection** (2/3)
- **Hilton San Diego Bayfront** (2/3)
    - Nothing spectacular. Not the closest to the bars, not the closest to the convention center. It is right on the harbour so the breakfast view is quite amazing.

### My to-try list

- **Pendry San Diego** 
    - Very modern and chic hotel in the middle of Gaslamp. I've gotten drinks, food and attended conferences here, but I've never stayed here. They have a champagne vending machine in the lobby -- enough said ;)
- **Hotel del Coronado** Cross reference ^ same entry above
