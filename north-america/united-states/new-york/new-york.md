## Food

### From experience

- **Le Coucou** (3/3)
    - To be fair, I'm totally biased in ranking Le Coucou -- never had a bad time here.
    - Le Coucou serves French food, Michelin 2 star -- so be prepared for fantastic food, drinks and services.  
- **Charlie Bird** (3/3)
	- It looks like Carmen never misses a hit. One of her favorite places in New York, the ambiance at Charlie Bird is modern and chic with a hiphop playlist. 
	- The Italian wine was spectacular, recommended by the onsite Sommelier.
	- Dishes: I loved the bread, the charred beets, and the tagliatette with lamb bolognese & parmigiano (also came highly recommended through Carmen).
- **Casa Mono** (3/3)
	- Spanish tapas near Union Square — small place with intimate vibe and lots of bar seats. If you have a larger party, reservation is a must. 
	- Dishes: mushroom, lamb, and amazing Spanish wine. 
- **Sushi Lin** (3/3)
	- Omakase is a must -- this place is in Brooklyn
	- Dishes: Sweet Shrimp with uni crust *drools*
- **Sichuan Mountain House 穿山甲** (3/3)

## Drinks

### From experience

- **Raines Law Room** (3/3)
	- Flat Iron and Midtown, one of the best cocktail bars EVER.
- **The Campbell Apartment** (3/3)
	- Grand Central, love the vibe, the history, and the architecture. 
	- Definitely a classy establishment. 
- **Bar at Soho Grand** (3/3)
    - One of my favorite spots in Soho - great cocktail and whiskey.
- **King Cole** (3/3)
	- Hotel bar at the St. Regis. Impeccable drinks (my favorites are the martinis here) and beautiful decor. The mural behind the bar is by Maxfield Parrish depicting Old King Cole. This bar is a New York staple in my opinion. 
	- If you are here for a drink, don't miss out on the doorman's booth at the front of the hotel. It's absolutely adorable. 
	- 2018 June: I came here with Lauren and Joe shortly after their engagement. So happy for these two! Annablle joined us for the party and it was such a fun night. 
- **The Polo Bar - Ralph Lauren** (3/3)
	- Right across from St. Regis -- so you can definitely shoot to cover both in one night. One of my favorite bits about this bar is that the drinks come with polo sticks as the stirs (oh and of course the whole place is decorated with great taste in Polo theme). The bar is on the ground level and there's actually a restaurant on the bottom level -- see restaurant section for food review.
- **Top of the Standard** (3/3)
	- Cocktail bar at the top of the Standard Hotel. VIEWS VIEWS VIEWS. It's right on highline with a great view of the Hudson. You can see sunset from the bar. 
    - Reservation is a must if you want a table. Jazz at night. 
- **Death and Company** (3/3)
    - Great cocktail & vibe
- **Please Don’t Tell** (3/3)
    - Great cocktail & vibe
- **Employees Only** (3/3)
    - Great cocktail & vibe
- **Bathtub Gin** (3/3)
    - Great cocktail - gin focused & vibe
- **Bar at The Roxy Hotel** (2/3)
	- Oyster happy hour, decent drinks, live music at certain hours
- **The Bar at Clement** (1/3)
	- Hotel bar at the Peninsula in midtown. Thumbs up for the ambiance and decor, but two thumbs down for the cocktails. I can't even finish the old fashioned. 
	- That being said, it's still on the list because it's the Peninsula. When I visited, the hallways are adorned with Keith Haring and Basquiat for an exhibition and the main hall hosts a classically beautiful christmas tree. I was upset with the drinks but it's hard to stay upset here.
