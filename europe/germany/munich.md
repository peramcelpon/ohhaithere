## Food

### From experience

- **Wirtshaus Zum Straubinger** (2/3)
	- Looking for Bavarian? This is it! Beer garden with sausage and meat and communal tables. 
	- The portions are HUGE. (2017 Nov) Danqing and I ordered a meat platter to share for two — it could literally feed a family with 4 kids. 
	- I marked it as 2 simply because I’m not a fan of Bavarian food, but it’s definitely worth a visit! 
- **Restaurant Roma** 
	- Italian; dinner with Kelli


### My to-try list

- **Brenner Grill** Italian cuisine in an impressively pillared chamber with modern decor -- Michelin guide restaurant. Recommended by Patrick. Ryan and Simon thought the food was good but nothing super special. 
- **Restaurant Broeding** six course, different every night; great wine, Austrian in particular
- **Mark’s** at Mandarin Oriental, seafood with an Asian note, awesome view — outdoor terrace overlooks old town; Michelin-starred; 
- **Restaurant 181** located in the Olympic Tower; signature dish as well as innovative selections; Michelin-starred; French, German; small and intimate; panoramic view
- **Tantris** Michelin starred, fine dining, Asian themed architecture 
- **Atelier**  Michelin starred, International cuisine 
- **Marais Soir** casually-chic Mediterranean bistro, Italian and French 
- **Ella** Italian restaurant at Lebachhaus; “Ella” came from Kandinsky’s pet name for Gabriella Münter; 
- **Koi** modern Japanese Izakaya-style tavern
- **Gratitude** vegan restaurant 
- **Wirtshaus Maximilian** contemporary Wirthaus

## Drinks

### From experience

- **Ruby Lilly Hotel & Bar** (3/3)
	- This hotel is right by Kelli’s apartment, and serves really decent cocktail by Bavarian standard. The lovely bartender kept popping by to make sure we are okay based on our cocktail consumption — quite entertaining. 
	- Memory from 2017 October: Juan joined us after work and we ended the night at their apartment with schnapps and the kitties. The hangover on day 2 almost murdered me but I somehow made it to Berlin one piece. 

### My to-try list

- **Schumann's** 
	- the main Schumann’s Bar (which transitions from restaurant to drinking hotspot around midnight) is accompanied by the smaller “Camparino” next door, and the intimate “Fleurs du Mal” on the first floor. Arrive early than late -- and always book a table just in case.
- **Die Goldene Bar** adjourning Haus der Kunst, summer is fantastic on terrace; cocktail and wine/beer
- **Zephyr Bar** fantastic gin selection for cocktails or straight
- **Bar Garçon** cocktail, relaxing casual spot; may be cash only
- **The High** top cocktail bar
- **Chinesischer Turm** Bierhaus in the English Garden — open May-September; outdoor; 
- **Augustiner-Keller** Classic Bavarian. exterior and interior, interior room is atmospheric, with vaulted-ceiling “keller”; beer served directly from wooden barrels

## Destinations

### From experience

- **Englischer Garten (English Garden)** (3/3)
	- An absolutely must. This is the place to bring a book, wine in mugs, along with a picnic blanket to just relax and hang out for an afternoon. If you happen to be in Munich in fall (October-ish), the layered colors embellishing the lake is simply superb. 
	- If you are into activities, there are lots of sights to see inside the English Garden — even a Chinese pagoda! 
- **Marienplatz (Mary’s Square)** (3/3)
	- The central square in Munich — very lively and surrounded by shopping areas. Fun to walk around day or night.

### My to-try list

- **Olympiapark** an Olympic Park which was constructed for the 1972 Summer Olympics; has a modern carillon
- **Deutsches Musuem** technology museum
- **National Theatre** where Mozart’s first opera premiered; great opera culture

---- 

## Art & Architecture

### From experience

- **Lenbachhaus (Municipal Gallery in Lebach House)** (3/3)
	- Great collection on European modern art — with a focus on the The Blue Rider (Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Franz Marc, etc.). 
	- The building was the residence of Franz von Lebach. Some of the ornaments are original and quite fun to look at (e.g. door handles). On a sunny day, the natural light dances with the displayed artworks for added effects. Definitely reserve some time to walk around and relax in the courtyard!

### My to-try list

- **Alte Pinakothek** old gallery; 14th- to 17th-century masterpieces by the likes of Dürer, Raphael, Rubens and Rembrandt
- **Neue Pinakothek** new gallery; Friedrich, Monet, Cézanne and van Gogh
- **Pinakothek der Moderne** modern gallery; art, graphic, architecture and design museum in one
- **Museum Brandhorst** one of the world's foremost Cy Twombly collections, as well as significant works by Damien Hirst, Gerhard Richter, Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons
- **Munich Residenz** the former royal palace of the Wittelsbach monarchs of Bavaria. The Residenz is the largest city palace in Germany and is open to visitors for its architecture, room decorations, and displays from the former royal collections. 
- **Asam Church**

## Lodging

### From experience

- **Roomers Munich, Autograph Collection** (3/3)
	- Boutique
- **Courtyard by Marriott, Munich City** (2/3)
	- Decent business hotel right by the train station and walking distance to the central area. The immediate neighborhood can seem a tad sketchy but commute is super easy.
